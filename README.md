# Puzzel
A memory puzzle that has characters stored in a grid and the user has 60 seconds to match all the pairs of symbols or letters hidden within the grid.
The user is supposed to input the row number and column to see the hidden letter and keep finding more symbols to match it with the inputs entered earlier.
The score gets added up once the user finds the matching pair one after the other.
